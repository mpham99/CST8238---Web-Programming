      <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p id = "p4">
      Minh Duc Pham was born in a small Asian country - Vietnam. His parents give him a name which has a beautiful, tear-jerking meaning in his native language. But for people at Starsbuck, it is a tounge twister and they butchered it too much that he has to pick an normal, boring, based on a famous actor name - Ryan. On the day he was born, the whole mation were shocked because the gasoline price went up that day.

        In general, he is a nice, emotionally unstable, easy to have a inner mental breakdown because of teeny tiny things in life. Used to have OCD that make him do his "rituals" everyday, but now it gets better. He listens to songs as long as it is catchy, no matter how trashy the song or the artist is. He like to do stuff related to computers, that why he convinced his parents to take this course, even though it is a 24h flight from his country to Canada and the "premium" fee which make the latest iPhone a reasonable deal.

      <p id = "p3">
        Like other normal 19 years old Asian kid, by far, most of his time was spent on going to school, do homework, going to "extra class" after school (English doesn't even have a term for that), trying not to be overrun by the deadline of 14 compulsory subjects in highschool. Right now he is in Computer Science course of Algonquin College, which is an interesting and pratical course. However, level 3 is giving him flashback of all the deadlines he had to manage in highschool.
